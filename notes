4 layers of comm
	app: user facing ; data-formatting, encryption, session management
	transport(TCP/UDP): transmission (softw); flow control, segmentation, reassembly
		TCP: connection oriented, reliable but slow (flow control, error checking, etc.)
		UDP: faster, connectionless transmission, no guarantees
	netw/internet(IP): navigator ; packet forwardingm fragmentation, logical addressing
		IP: assign unique IP addresses to devices, picks the most efficient path for data transmission
	netw access: physical transmission (hardw); MAC addressing, error detection at hardw link (Ethernet, WiFi etc.)

user data
==> app formats
==> broken up into packets, given headers and src/dst ports, picks TCP or UDP
==> adds the IP addresses to each packet, and picks its opt route
==> packets->frames, adds MAC addresses, sends data as binary bits
pick up
==> receives (frames->packets ?)
==> checks IP addresses, removes, IP header
==> reassembles TCP segs in order, checks data integrity
==> delivers data to app for reception
