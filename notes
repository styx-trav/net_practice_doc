4 layers of comm
	app: user facing ; data-formatting, encryption, session management
	transport(TCP/UDP): transmission (softw); flow control, segmentation, reassembly
		TCP: connection oriented, reliable but slow (flow control, error checking, etc.)
		UDP: faster, connectionless transmission, no guarantees
	netw/internet(IP): navigator ; packet forwardingm fragmentation, logical addressing
		IP: assign unique IP addresses to devices, picks the most efficient path for data transmission
	netw access: physical transmission (hardw); MAC addressing, error detection at hardw link (Ethernet, WiFi etc.)

user data
==> app formats
==> broken up into packets, given headers and src/dst ports, picks TCP or UDP
==> adds the IP addresses to each packet, and picks its opt route
==> packets->frames, adds MAC addresses, sends data as binary bits
pick up
==> receives (frames->packets ?)
==> checks IP addresses, removes, IP header
==> reassembles TCP segs in order, checks data integrity
==> delivers data to app for reception

subnet masks :: 
divides up the IP address into host : 255, and device 0;
standard home mask 255.255.255.0, so if home computer 192.0.5.63, then home alexa 192.0.5.?
IPs can be divided binarily, too. so, home computer IP :
11000000.00000000.00000101.00111111
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128

okay, so : the rules, deduced from trial and error

	cannot overflow (0 - 255)
	mask : 255.255.255.224 seems to mean :
		range-size:: 255 - 224 = 31
		range from 224 - 31 = 193 to 222 (always 2 unused for network reasons)
	so it reasons that ::
	mask : 255.255.255.252 implies
		range-size:: 255 - 252 = 3
		range from 252 - 3 = 249 to 250
		test confirms, and adds the range can also start from 0 (1;2 [no 0]instead of 249;250)
	further tests imply range can start anywhere ? unsure
		(ex: ...224 && ...240 masks, range 132 (130, 131, with established 129-142 range (size 15))
	loopback address (localhost) == 127.0.0.1 -->unusable, switch 128
	all interfaces on a router need different masks for distribution
	been doing interface mask == host mask, unsure if needed, seen evidence against
	device routes :: default (unless internet, in which case refer to sent package (ex:8.8.8.8/0)) -> adjoined interface
	
	
	
128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1

1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0

4 bits for address, so 2^4 = 16; broadcast addresses 15
address at .12 so between 0 and 16, within a 163.49.250.0/28 subnet
valid host range 14 :	subnet 163.49.250.0
			min address 163.49.250.1
			max address 163.49.250.14
			host address 163.49.250.15


same for our destination from the internet ::

128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1

1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

6 bits for address, so 2^6 = 64; broadcast addresses 63
subnet at .0 so between 0 and 64, within a 170.141.205.0/26 subnet
valid host range 62 :	subnet 170.141.205.0
			min address 170.141.205.1
			max address 170.141.205.62
			host address 170.141.205.63


ooooookay, so just : a rewording of our rules ::
	all subnet masks should match on a network (including router int to router int), and the range must as well
	ranges must differ between router interfaces so they're sent in the proper direction
	if a destination + mask is set in a reroute, all destinations must be in range, and then divided within separate ranges if necessary
